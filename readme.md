# warning

 * I ran out of time to submit things and this version isn't very clean or well
   commmented. I wanted to correctly implement a solution using dynamic
   programming but ended up just cacheing things instead (I do plan to rewrite
   things in a way that makes more sense :D)
 * I haven't had time to check my code carefully. This answer might not be correct :D
