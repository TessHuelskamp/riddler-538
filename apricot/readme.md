> You loaded a drying shed containing 1,000 kilograms of apricots. They were 99 percent water. After a day in the shed, they are now 98 percent water. How much do the apricots weigh now?

# Working it out

1. Pre-drying:
    * 1000 kg total
    * 990 kg of water
    * 10 kg of apricot
1. Post-drying:
    * X kg total
    * Still 10 kg of apricot
    * 10 kg is  2 percent of the total mass (98 percent water -> 2 percent "apricot")
    * `X * .02 = 10` -> `X = 500`
    * Apricots ("apricot" + water) are now 500 kg (490 kg of water total)
