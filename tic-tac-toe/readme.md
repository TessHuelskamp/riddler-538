# "Solutions"
## Turned in
I made a coding error when declaring what rows would count as a win earlier. The answer I got there was 517,536.

## Fixed the error
After I fixed my coding error, I found that there were 510,336 different games.

This differs from the given correct solution which is (255,168). However, my solution is exactly twice that number. I assumed that a game would be different if depending on which player went first (they didn't) so :shrug: that's just a difference of opinions :)

# Usage
