> How many possible games of tic-tac-toe are there?

# Explanation
Wrote a class to simulate a game of tic-tac-toe so that I could enumerate and then count all possible, valid games.

# Usage
1. `javac Main.java`
1. `java Main`


# Solutions

## Turned in
In my original solution, I incorrectly coded how wins were counted. I expected there to be `517536` games.

## Fixed the error
After I fixed my coding error, I found that there were `510336` different games.

This differs from the given correct solution (which was `255168`).
However, my solution is exactly twice that number.
I assumed that a game would be different if depending on which player went first (they didn't) so :shrug: that's just a difference of opinions :)
